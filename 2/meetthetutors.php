            &ldquo;Hello, there! I really enjoy teaching French but
            also the culture of the country. I have a dual, cultral
            background as I grew up in Madagascar. I believe that
            this has enabled me to be more understanding of
            people&rsquo;s needs in terms of learning and
            acquiring a new language.&rdquo;
