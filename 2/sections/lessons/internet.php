            Now you don't need to live in the same town as your tutor. Thanks 
            to the internet, you can book your class, AND have your lesson 
            online wherever you are! All you need is a headset and Skype, which 
            is free to download <a href="http://www.skype.com">here</a>. If you 
            have a webcam, you will be able to see the tutor and vice-versa. 
            Tuition is specially designed to suit each individual's 
            requirements.
