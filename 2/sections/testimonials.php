        Thank you Sophie for all of the lessons we had together which I 
        thoroughly enjoyed. Your teaching greatly increased my overall 
        confidence and I was very able to converse with my colleagues in French 
        whilst in Morocco!<br /><br />

        &hellip; it means she got three A-levels and has been offered a place 
        at University. Without your tuition she would definitely have 
        failed her French, and therefore not gone to University - so a HUGE 
        thank you for your help.<br /><br />
